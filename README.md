# hubitat-dashboard

Hubitat Dashboard UI tweaks - a collection of modern "skins" for Hubitat Dashboard.  

- *smartly* - loosely based on the modern SmartThings app, with some direction from ActionTiles Slate skin.

### Getting Started

As there isn't an actual 'skin' system for Hubitat Dashboard, the easiest way to use these skins is to create a new dashboard then following the copy and paste instructions.  If you would like to keep your existing tiles, you'll need to backup your "tiles:[]" data from your existing JSON, and replace the empty "tiles:[]" line in our JSON.

### Installing

- Copy and paste the contents of .json into Options > Advanced > Layout then 'Save JSON'.
- Copy and paste the contents of .css into Options > Advanced > CSS then 'Save CSS'.
